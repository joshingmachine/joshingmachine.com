<h1>About</h1>

<p>Hi! I’m Josh Smith.</p>

<p>I work as an engineering manager for the Front End Engineering team at <a href="https://www.niche.com">Niche</a>, a platform that helps people find the colleges, schools, and places to live that are right for them.</p>

<p>I'm a lifelong resident of Pittsburgh, PA, where I live with my wife and our muppet of a dog.</p>

<p>Some of my interests include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>spending quality time with family and friends</li>
	<li>reading (most genres and formats)</li>
	<li>comedy (consuming standup and satire)</li>
	<li>games (mostly the board and Nintendo varieties)</li>
	<li>code, startups, and tech (especially tech ethics and EdTech)</li>
	<li>Pixar movies (I have strong feelings about <cite>Toy Story 4</cite>)</li>
</ul>

<p>You can find more information about me at the following links:</p>

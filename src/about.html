<h1>About</h1>

<p>Hi! I'm Josh Smith. I'm passionate about making opportunities accessible to everyone, and I believe a crucial part of that is education.</p>

<p>In service of that, I work as an engineering manager for the front end engineering team at <a href="https://www.niche.com">Niche</a>, a website and app that helps people find the colleges, schools, and places to live that are right for them.</p>

<p>I live in Pittsburgh with my wife and our muppet of a dog. Some of my interests include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>reading (books, articles, essays, humor, history, engineering and business practices, soft sci-fi and fantasy)</li>
	<li>Pixar movies</li>
	<li>cooking (especially savory breakfast foods)</li>
	<li>watching stand-up comedy</li>
</ul>

<p>You can find more information about me at the following links:</p>

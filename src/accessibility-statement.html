<h1>Accessibility Statement</h1>

<p>I want this website and the content on it to be accessible to as many people as possible.</p>

<p>In that effort, I aim to comply with all applicable standards. At the minimum, I strive to conform with <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1</a> level AA.</p>

<p>This webpage is a living document. On it I will describe what efforts I take to <a href="#ensuring-accessibility">ensure accessibility</a>, as well as acknowledge any <a href="#known-issues">known issues</a> with this website.</p>

<p>If you encounter an issue on this website that makes it or the content on it harder to access, please <a href="https://github.com/joshingmachine/joshingmachine.com/issues/new">file a GitHub Issue</a> on the repo or <a href="/contact/">contact me</a>. I take these issues very seriously, and will address any known issues as promptly as possible.</p>
